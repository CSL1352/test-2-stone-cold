        "There’s no such thing as an easy victory when you’re facing me."
        "I'm not here to make a good impression, I’m here to win and break some skulls!"
        "You can call it what you want, but I call it Stone Cold justice."
        "I never back down, never give up, and I sure as hell never quit!"
        "Some say I’m a rebel, but I’m just a man who does what needs to be done."
        "The louder you scream, the harder I’m gonna hit you."
        "Don’t mistake kindness for weakness, I’ll whip your ass and make you like it!"
        "You step into my ring, you’re stepping into a world of hurt."
        "Stone Cold doesn’t need fancy tricks. He just beats your ass straight up!"
        "When you mess with me, you're messing with the toughest SOB to ever walk the Earth."
        "I’ve broken bones, but I’ve never broken spirit."
        "The bottom line is simple: If you’re not willing to fight, you’re not Stone Cold."
        "I don’t need luck, I’ve got experience, toughness, and the will to win!"
